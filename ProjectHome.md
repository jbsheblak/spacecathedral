# Details #

Outer Space Cathedral is a shoot'm'up game created for a New Year's party in 2011.

The game is split into four levels, which are unlocked as the night progresses.

Unlock schedule:
  * First Frontier - initial unlocked.
  * Ocean Orchestra - unlocked at 10:00PM
  * Cathedral 300 - unlocked at 11:00PM
  * SECRET - unlocked at 11:58PM

The idea with this game was to run it on a PC or XBOX in a communal area and leave it running through the night. A loud signal noise will occur when a new level is unlocked. It's meant as an event the party can check up on throughout the night.
